The idea behind this website is fairly simple. A combination of HTML, CSS, and javascript are used to develop the website. Additional thirs part API's, such as bootstrap and JQuery are also used. In order to keep all events, plans and scheduling on the page even when it is refreshed, local storage is utilized. Local storage will contain all plans and text inputs will be retrieved every time the page is refreshed. Moreover, the current time is displayed. The hour blocks in the planner will mirror the current time as past hours turn grey, future hours turn green, and the current hour is displayed as red. This simple addition allows for the user to not lose track of time.
